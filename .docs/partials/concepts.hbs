## Basic concepts

- Bap runs at *96 ticks per beat*, with a position signature like MPC: ```bar.beat.tick```
- Kits are like instruments (programs in MPC terms) and contains infinite slots, each with infinite layers of samples and oscillators
- Patterns are playable collections of channels containing notes, and connect with kits
- Notes are defined by six main parameters: position, target, duration, volume, pan and pitch
- Only position and target params are required, all others can be null/falsy/undefined
- Positions containing [expressions](https://github.com/adamrenklint/dilla-expressions#operators) are automatically expanded
- When a layer is played, it merges the params of the note, channel, layer, slot and kit
