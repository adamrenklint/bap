[Bap](http://bapjs.org) is a toolkit for making beats and composing sequences with Javascript and Web Audio for playback in modern browsers. It is inspired by the classic "MPC workflow" and built to make all aspects of beatmaking completely modular and reusable.

**The project is in an early stage, and things may change and break between minor versions.**
